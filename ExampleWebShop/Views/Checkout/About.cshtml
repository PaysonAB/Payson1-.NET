        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This is a basic web shop that use Payson to handle payments. Its purpose is to demo
            how a Payson checkout can look when integrated in a site. It is configured to use
            the Payson test environment, so feel free to click around and try to buy a couple
            of items!</p>
        <p>
            The shop has most of the basic functionality that a real shop would have, and supports
            both Credit Card, Bank and Invoice payment options. However, it lacks an administration
            interface and it does not store any data but relies on the Payson account.</p>
        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <p>
            The full source of the site is available on <a href="https://github.com/PaysonAktiebolag/api-integration-dotnet">
                GitHub</a>. Feel free to download it and try it out yourself!</p>
        <p>
            <p>
                The shop is built in ASP.Net MVC 3 with C# and uses the C# helper library available
                in the <a href="https://github.com/PaysonAktiebolag">Payson GitHub organisation</a> to integrate
                with the Payson API. It is configured to use the test API at <a href="https://test-api.payson.se">
                    https://test-api.payson.se</a>, meaning no money will be moved, and no items
                will be shipped.
            </p>
